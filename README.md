The main problem of general purpose learning application is that they are too "general".
Think about learning german word, in a gen-purpose app there are too many words to learn for a student, instead a teacher give to their student a predefined set of word the students have to study.

So, as a father of one of the girl enrolled in SM Tesserete, i pursue the goal of, in the my limit of time effort knowledge and so on, developing an application for helping kids to studies the words that the teacher will ask.

In my mind the result would be cover many other school subjects, so it is a never endingo work... 

Enjoy schooltasks.
Happy learning
